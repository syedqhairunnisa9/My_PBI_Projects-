This Power BI dashboard presents insights from a survey of 630 data professionals. Key metrics include average age (29.87), job satisfaction levels (work-life balance: 5.74/10, salary: 4.27/10), and salary distribution by job title. It also visualizes the popularity of programming languages (Python being the most favored), perceived difficulty in entering the data field, and demographic distribution across countries. This visualization aims to provide a holistic view of trends, preferences, and challenges within the data profession landscape.
